A simple movie trailer website project I achieved for Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The project uses python script to generate a website that display a list of movies and you can watch the trailers by clicking each movie's poster.

# Require

# Quick start

2. Open terminal and cd to the extracted folder

A website will be open in your webbrowser and you can watch the movie trailer by clicking the poster images!
